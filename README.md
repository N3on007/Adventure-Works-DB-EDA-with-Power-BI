#Adventure Works Data analysis with Power BI

Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights and visualizations into the AdventureWorks database, which is a sample database provided by Microsoft for learning and testing purposes.

The AdventureWorks database contains data related to a fictitious bicycle manufacturer, including information on products, sales, customers, and employees. In this project, we will use Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize the data in order to gain a better understanding of the business operations of AdventureWorks.

To get started with this project, you will need to have access to the AdventureWorks database and have Microsoft Power BI installed on your computer. The analysis and visualization will be performed through Power BI, and the results will be presented in the form of interactive reports and dashboards
